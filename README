sftponly is a simple shell for accounts only meant to upload/download
files, even with the chrooted accounts.

It was intended to be simpler in administration and use than scponly in
that it does not require any executables, libraries nor device files in
user's home. The only thing the administrator needs to setup such an
account is to `chmod u+s' on sftponly binary and to set it as shell for
an account. All the rest will be handled by sftponly.

The goal of zero-administration was achieved by running sftp-server/scp/rsync
with shared library libchroot.so pre-loaded (LD_PRELOAD), This library calls
chroot() on loading.

Thanks to this all the sftponly code is as short as 400 lines in C.
